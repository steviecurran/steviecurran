### SUMMARY ###
Data-focused researcher with 20+ years of experience applying machine learning, statistical modelling, Python-based data analysis, and quantitative problem‑solving to large, complex datasets. Strong communicator with extensive experience leading analytical projects, mentoring teams, and delivering clear insights to technical and non‑technical audiences.

### SINDUSTRY‑ALIGNED PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
 - **Machine Learning Classification of Galaxies**: Built ML models (sklearn, tensorflow) to classify galaxy properties from multi‑feature datasets. Improved prediction accuracy vs. baseline models and delivered interpretable insights for scientific users.

- **Neural Network Redshift Estimation**: Designed and trained deep learning models to estimate galaxy redshifts, replacing manual feature‑driven estimation with automated approaches.

- **A/B Testing & Statistical Tooling**: Wrote Python tools implementing A/B testing, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing suitable for product, marketing, or business analytics contexts.
  
- **Data Visualisation**: Developed applications for exploring high‑dimensional astrophysical and experimental datasets.
